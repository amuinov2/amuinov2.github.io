    "title": "Are Tennis’s “New Two” As Clutch As The “Big Three”?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past 20 years, we have been fortunate enough to witness something unprecedented in the world of mens’ tennis. Three players, all masters of their craft, battling it out for almost every major tournament, accolade, ranking, and everything in between. Roger Federer. Rafael Nadal. Novak Djokovic. Better known as the “Big Three,” these titans of tennis spent two decades dominating a sport where individual success means everything. Some perspective on each of these players’ legendary careers:\nRoger Federer: 1998-2022, 103 Singles Titles, 20 Grand Slam Titles\nRafael Nadal: 2001-2024, 92 Singles Titles, 22 Grand Slam Titles\nNovak Djokovic: 2003-Present, 101 Singles Titles, 24 Grand Slam Titles\nUnfortunately, all good things must come to an end. With Federer and Nadal already having retired and Djokovic soon to follow at the age of 38, rising stars have been taking over the sport. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, colloquially known as the “New Two,” are the big names in tennis today, hovering atop the rankings and winning the majority of competitions. Turning pro around ages 16-18, they would appear, at first, to be on track to catch up to the Big Three, players they idolized as children. The latter legends, though, weren’t just winners - they were supremely clutch where it mattered. From tiebreakers to break points, they took control when everything was on the line. Any tennis player can speak to the importance of not cracking under pressure in moments like these, making it all the more impressive that they managed to keep up that level of play for over 20 years. The recent changing of the guard in mens’ tennis now begs the question - are the “New Two” as clutch as the “Big Three” were, and more importantly, can they keep it up for another decade and a half?\nTiebreakers in tennis occur when the score of a set is tied at 6-6. Points are played until a player reaches 7 or 10 (depending on the format of the match), and they win the set. On their day, even a bad player can turn the tide of a match by winning these.\n\n\nCode\n### Load Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\n### Load, Merge, and Clean Data}\ntennis_files &lt;- list.files(\"tennis_atp-master\",\n  pattern = \"atp_matches_\\\\d{4}\\\\.csv\",\n  full.names = TRUE\n)\n\n# Merge all files to create master dataframe\nall_matches &lt;- tennis_files |&gt;\n  map_df(read_csv)\n\n# Limit dataframe to only Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Sinner, and Alcaraz\nbig_five &lt;- c(\"Roger Federer\", \"Rafael Nadal\", \"Novak Djokovic\", \"Jannik Sinner\", \"Carlos Alcaraz\")\n\nall_matches &lt;- all_matches |&gt;\n  filter(winner_name %in% big_five | loser_name %in% big_five) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    tourney_id = gsub(\"\\\\-.*\", \"\", tourney_id)\n  ) |&gt;\n  rename(year = tourney_id) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year = as.numeric(year)\n  )\n\n### Line Chart Data\nline_data &lt;- all_matches |&gt;\n  separate(\n    score,\n    into = paste0(\"set\", 1:5),\n    sep = \" \",\n    fill = \"right\"\n  )\n\n# Make data long\nline_long &lt;- line_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"set\"),\n    names_to = \"set_number\",\n    values_to = \"set_score\",\n    values_drop_na = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Filter only tiebreak sets\ntiebreak_sets &lt;- line_long |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(set_score, \"7-6|6-7\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    clean = gsub(\"\\\\(.*\\\\)\", \"\", set_score),\n    tb_winner = if_else(str_starts(set_score, \"7\"),\n      winner_name,\n      loser_name\n    ),\n    tb_loser = if_else(tb_winner == winner_name,\n      loser_name,\n      winner_name\n    )\n  )\n\n# Count tiebreak wins per player\nline_final &lt;- tiebreak_sets |&gt;\n  group_by(year, tb_winner) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    tb_wins = n(),\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(tb_winner %in% big_five)\n\n# Standardize by year of career and include only first 10 years\nline_final_std &lt;- line_final |&gt;\n  group_by(tb_winner) |&gt;\n  arrange(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(career_year = row_number()) |&gt;\n  filter(career_year &lt;= 10)\n\n# Sinner only\nsinner_line &lt;- line_final_std |&gt;\n  filter(tb_winner == \"Jannik Sinner\")\n\n# Alcaraz only\nalcaraz_line &lt;- line_final_std |&gt;\n  filter(tb_winner == \"Carlos Alcaraz\")\n\n# Big Three only\nbig_three &lt;- line_final_std |&gt;\n  filter(tb_winner %in% c(\"Roger Federer\", \"Rafael Nadal\", \"Novak Djokovic\"))\n\n### Plot Line Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = big_three, aes(x = career_year, y = tb_wins, group = tb_winner), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data = sinner_line, aes(x = career_year, y = tb_wins), color = \"black\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_line(data = alcaraz_line, aes(x = career_year, y = tb_wins), color = \"gold\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(data = sinner_line |&gt; filter(career_year == 5), aes(x = career_year, y = tb_wins + 2, label = tb_winner), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = alcaraz_line |&gt; filter(career_year == 5), aes(x = career_year, y = tb_wins - 2, label = tb_winner), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(1, 10, 1),\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Triumphing in Tough Points\",\n    subtitle = \"Tiebreaks are a defacto \\\"clutch moment\\\" in any tennis match.

With such variation in tiebreak wins between the five players, the New Two have a chance to prove themselves worthy of legend status if they continue succeeding in these pivotal moments.\nBreak points, or points where players have a chance to win a game their opponent is serving on, are only slightly more common than tiebreakers. Whereas the latter may help players in the grand scheme of a match, the former are the best opportunities to quickly take control of a set. Thus, break points are some of the highest-pressure moments for both players on court, and can’t be ignored.\n\n\nCode\n### Slope Chart Data\nslope_data &lt;- all_matches |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year = year,\n    player = winner_name,\n    bp_converted = l_bpFaced - l_bpSaved,\n    bp_created = l_bpFaced\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(year, player, bp_converted, bp_created) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(\n    all_matches |&gt;\n      mutate(\n        year = year,\n        player = loser_name,\n        bp_converted = w_bpFaced - w_bpSaved,\n        bp_created = w_bpFaced\n      ) |&gt;\n      select(year, player, bp_converted, bp_created)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% big_five) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    bp_created = sum(bp_created, na.rm = TRUE),\n    bp_converted = sum(bp_converted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    bp_conversion_rate = bp_converted / bp_created\n  )\n\n# Standardize by year of career\nplayer_year &lt;- slope_data |&gt;\n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  arrange(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    career_year = row_number()\n  )\n\n# Define early career (first five years)\nearly_career &lt;- player_year |&gt;\n  filter(career_year &lt;= 5) |&gt;\n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    timeframe = \"Early Career\",\n    bp_conversion_rate = mean(bp_conversion_rate, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Define peak career (find best 3 consecutive seasons using rolling average)\nplayer_year_lag &lt;- player_year |&gt;\n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  arrange(career_year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    prev_year_bp_rate = lag(bp_conversion_rate, n = 1),\n    two_year_bp_rate = lag(bp_conversion_rate, n = 2),\n    rolling_three_year_avg = (bp_conversion_rate + prev_year_bp_rate + two_year_bp_rate) / 3\n  )\n\npeak_career &lt;- player_year_lag |&gt;\n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  filter(rolling_three_year_avg == max(rolling_three_year_avg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  select(player, bp_conversion_rate = rolling_three_year_avg) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    timeframe = \"Peak Career\"\n  )\n\n# Combine into final slope chart data\nslope_data_final &lt;- early_career |&gt;\n  bind_rows(peak_career)\n\n# Sinner Dataframe\nslope_data_sinner &lt;- slope_data_final |&gt;\n  filter(player == \"Jannik Sinner\")\n\n# Alcaraz Dataframe\nslope_data_alcaraz &lt;- slope_data_final |&gt;\n  filter(player == \"Carlos Alcaraz\")\n\n### Slope Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = slope_data_final, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(data = slope_data_final, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 4) +\n  geom_line(data = slope_data_sinner, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"black\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(data = slope_data_sinner, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n  geom_line(data = slope_data_alcaraz, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"gold\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(data = slope_data_alcaraz, aes(x = timeframe, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player), color = \"gold\", size = 4) +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_final |&gt; filter(!player %in% c(\"Carlos Alcaraz\", \"Jannik Sinner\") & timeframe == \"Peak Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) + 1.25, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player, label = player)) +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_final |&gt; filter(!player %in% c(\"Carlos Alcaraz\", \"Jannik Sinner\") & timeframe == \"Early Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) - 0.25, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player, label = player)) +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_sinner |&gt; filter(timeframe == \"Peak Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) + 1.25, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player, label = player), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_sinner |&gt; filter(timeframe == \"Early Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) - 0.25, y = bp_conversion_rate + 0.01, group = player, label = player), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_alcaraz |&gt; filter(timeframe == \"Peak Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) + 1.25, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player, label = player), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = slope_data_alcaraz |&gt; filter(timeframe == \"Early Career\"), aes(x = as.numeric(factor(timeframe)) - 0.25, y = bp_conversion_rate, group = player, label = player), fontface = \"bold\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0.35, 0.55, 0.05),\n    limits = c(0.35, 0.55)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Breaking Through Or Being Broken?\",\n    subtitle = \"Break points can turn the tide and momentum of a match by giving players chances to defeat opponents \\non their serve.

This was calculated as follows:\nBreak Point Conversion Rate (BPCR): Break Points Converted (won) / Break Points Created (all opportunities)\nThree-Year Rolling Average: (BPCR (-2 years) + BPCR (-1 year) + BPCR (current year)) / 3\nSomething to note: Since Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have only been playing for 5 years, we consider “Peak Career” to mean the best three years of their career thus far, based on BPCR.\nAll players showed an increase in BPCR over the course of their careers, but they would be hard-pressed to match the level of Rafael Nadal, who had an astonishing BPCR of 0.52 over his best three years. That is to say, he converted over half of all break points he encountered, a display of clutch ability that may never again be matched. Alcaraz and Sinner, while once again trending in the right direction, will need to show true and sustained dominance if they hope to match such results.\nWhen all is said and done, any clutch performance a tennis player might muster up means nothing if they don’t win. Those who get their names engraved on Grand Slam trophies and go down as legends of the sport are the ones who win matches, whether dominantly or by digging in and playing with grit. Breaking it down even further, sets must be won to win matches, but how players win them can vary greatly.\n\n\nCode\n##### Stacked Bar Chart (SBC) Data\nsbc_data &lt;- all_matches |&gt;\n  separate(\n    score,\n    into = paste0(\"set\", 1:5),\n    sep = \" \",\n    fill = \"right\"\n  )\n\n# Make SBC data long\nsbc_long &lt;- sbc_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"set\"),\n    names_to = \"set_number\",\n    values_to = \"set_score\",\n    values_drop_na = TRUE\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(winner_name %in% big_five) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    clean = gsub(\"\\\\(.*\\\\)\", \"\", set_score)\n  )\n\n# Categorize data by type of set win\nsbc_categorized &lt;- sbc_long |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    set_category = case_when(\n      clean %in% c(\"6-0\", \"6-1\", \"6-2\") ~ \"Dominant Win (6-0, 6-1, 6-2)\",\n      clean %in% c(\"7-5\", \"6-4\", \"6-3\") ~ \"Clutch/Normal Win (6-3, 6-4, 7-5)\",\n      clean %in% c(\"7-6\") ~ \"Tiebreak Win (7-6)\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other/Long Set Wins\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(set_category != \"Other/Long Set Wins\")\n\n# Player order for chart\nplayer_order &lt;- c(\"Roger Federer\", \"Rafael Nadal\", \"Novak Djokovic\", \"Carlos Alcaraz\", \"Jannik Sinner\")\n\n# Count sets won in each category and order them by player\nfinal_sbc_data &lt;- sbc_categorized |&gt;\n  group_by(winner_name, set_category) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    sets_won_in_category = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop_last\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  rename(player = winner_name) |&gt;\n  rename(Category = set_category) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    total_sets = sum(sets_won_in_category),\n    percentage_of_total = sets_won_in_category / total_sets\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    player = factor(player, levels = player_order)\n  )\n\n# Big Three dataframe\nbig_three_sbc &lt;- final_sbc_data |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% c(\"Roger Federer\", \"Rafael Nadal\", \"Novak Djokovic\"))\n\n# Sinner dataframe\nsin_alc_sbc &lt;- final_sbc_data |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% c(\"Carlos Alcaraz\", \"Jannik Sinner\"))\n\n### Stacked Bar Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = big_three_sbc, aes(x = player, weight = percentage_of_total, fill = Category), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_bar(data = sin_alc_sbc, aes(x = player, weight = percentage_of_total, fill = Category)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"lightblue\", \"blue\", \"navy\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"At The End Of The Day, You've Got To Win\",\n    subtitle = \"The Big Three played for 20+ years, accumulating thousands of set wins in each category.

Although the Big Three have won thousands of sets of each category as opposed to just a few hundred for the New Two, both groups seem to win matches in roughly the same ways, including a large percentage of clutch wins. Were a top 80-200 player to be included in this analysis instead, the results would almost certainly look quite different. Only time will tell if, in a few thousand matches, these proportions continue to align.\nThere’s little doubt that Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are two of the best tennis players on tour today. Their unprecedented success only 5 years into their careers may speak for itself, but is it really time to call them the next “big thing”? At a glance, it sure looks like these “New Two” are playing the same kind of tennis their idols played their entire careers. They’re winning more and more tiebreakers each year. They convert break points often. They win clutch sets and succeed where it matters. Again, though, they’ve only played half a decade. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic all played (or are playing) for the greater part of a quarter-century, and not just played, but obliterated the competition. It’s certainly not out of the question that Sinner and Alcaraz could one day do the same, but with other rising stars never far behind, this remains to be seen. What’s for certain is that fans have years of great tennis ahead. Enjoy the show, and check back for a follow-up post around 2045 or so."

The pinnacle of motorsport boasting the fastest cars in the world. What began as a simple racing spectacle in the 1950s has evolved rapidly into one of the most impressive displays of technology and engineering in the world. A skilled driver can often no longer win a race on his own - layers of strategy, a well-designed car, and precise team cohesion must all come together to deliver a near-flawless race day for him to see the podium. Among these factors, perhaps none have changed over time quite as drastically as the pitstop. A car takes a risk by entering the pit lane at reduced speed and getting its old tires swapped out by a team of skilled mechanics, hoping to eventually regain lost positions on new, fresher tires. Over the years, additional elements like refueling have come and gone from the official F1 pit stop regulations, but the core idea behind these crucial breaks in racing remains the same - immediate risk for eventual speed.\nSince the ban of refueling and the onset of the “modern” era of Formula 1 racing in 2010, two teams have dominated the sport - Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team and Oracle Red Bull Racing. Relatively new teams at the time that had evolved out of older, less successful teams, each went on multi-year championship runs led by stars like Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen. However, such success begs the question - was it truly the pure racing skill of their drivers, their highly advanced cars, or something else that was responsible for their success? This post investigates whether or not the speed of the humble pitstop played a role in these racing dynasties. Are championships truly pieced together like the four tires on a race car? Or are drivers and engineers truly the driving factors? Let’s find out.\nFor reference: Red Bull won the Formula 1 Constructor’s Championship from 2010-2013, and again in 2022 and 2023. Mercedes won the championship from 2014-2021.\nTo analyze pitstops, which vary so greatly in duration, duration has been averaged out and ranked across the ten current F1 teams.\nRed Bull’s operational and technical efficiency in the pits has been on full display throughout both of their runs. Mercedes? They’ve jumped up and down.\n\n\nCode\n### Plot Data\n\n# Bump Chart - focus on particular team\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data = bump_data, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = bump_data, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bump(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"#00A19B\", size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"#00A19B\", size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_bump(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"navy\", size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"navy\", size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = mrb_min_year, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, label = team),\n    nudge_x = 0.3, nudge_y = 1, size = 4, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(2011, 2024, 1),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    breaks = seq(1, max(bump_data$pit_rank), 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Dominating the Decade from the Pits\",\n    subtitle = \"Red Bull and Mercedes have dominated Formula 1 for the past 15 years. However, Red Bull has ruled the pits \\nin each of its championship seasons, while Mercedes has not - are other factors at play for the Silver Arrows?\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Pit Stop Ranking (based on average duration)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Red Bull’s pit ranking took significant hits following their initial success. This coincided with the introduction of the hybrid V6 engine, a change that Mercedes capitalized on significantly to begin their string of championships. However, this isn’t to say that Red Bull sank to the bottom - their stops just weren’t the quickest anymore.\nAcross the board, F1’s elite racing teams are VERY consistent with their stops. Every team has their good days and their bad days, but over time, their stops vary little. Over the past 15 years Red Bull has remained the most consistent, with Mercedes only a few places behind. Other, less successful teams stand between the two, indicating stops may not always be a huge differentiating factor.\n\n\nCode\n# Dumbbell Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = dumb_data, aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"), aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2.5,\n    colour = \"#00A19B\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"), aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2.5,\n    colour = \"navy\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = fastest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(fastest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = -2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = slowest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(slowest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = 2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = fastest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(fastest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = -2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = slowest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(slowest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = 2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(10, 60),\n    breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 5),\n    minor_breaks = NULL\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impressive Speed or Costly Stumbles?\",\n    subtitle = \"F1 teams tend to have a similar range between their fastest and slowest stops. While Red Bull's smaller range \\nshowcases their technical and strategic expertise, Mercedes' isn't significantly better than some midfield teams.'\",\n    x = \"Pit Stop Duration (Seconds)\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm. It’s starting to look like Lewis Hamilton may really just have been THAT good. Maybe.\nBeyond stop consistency, though, we come back to our original question: Have we seen clear evidence of pit stops correlating with championship success? Let’s look at the clearest indicator of championship success - places and points over the course of different seasons.\n\n\nCode\n##### Bubble Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = bubble_data, aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(bubble_data, team == \"Mercedes\"), aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"#00A19B\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(bubble_data, team == \"Red Bull\"), aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"navy\") +\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    limits = c(1, 10),\n    breaks = seq(1, 10, by = 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Do Teams Get From the Pits to the Points?\",\n    subtitle = \"Mercedes' (teal) stops weren't significantly faster or slower than most teams', while Red Bull's (navy) \\nsometimes were. Both teams, however, consistently placed high and took home the largest number of points.\",\n    x = \"Average Pit Stop Duration (seconds)\",\n    y = \"Average Season Finishing Position\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s no surprise that Red Bull and Mercedes have scored the largest amount of points and consistently had some of the highest finishing positions in the modern era. What’s interesting is that other teams’ stop durations tended to be around the same, if only a second or two slower, on average. While the two titans almost always placed higher, they didn’t necessarily seem to have superb stops. Red Bull had a couple seasons of brilliance, but even these appear to be outliers.\nThe Formula One World Championship has been more or less of a two-horse race in recent years. Success in the pit lane has appeared to be more of a factor for Red Bull, who are known for their strict operational efficiency, than for Mercedes. Getting the jump on the hybrid era and bringing on superstar Lewis Hamilton seemed to have been enough for the Silver Arrows, whereas Red Bull relied more on a combination of strategy and technology for their success. While it’s McLaren that’s been dominating both of these spheres the past two years, old champions can easily rise again in the ever-changing landscape of F1. Only time will tell if their time in the metaphorical pit lane this season , away from the championship race, will pay off."

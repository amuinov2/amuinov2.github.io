The pinnacle of motorsport boasting the fastest cars in the world. What began as a simple racing spectacle in the 1950s has evolved rapidly into one of the most impressive displays of technology and engineering in the world. A skilled driver can often no longer win a race on his own - layers of strategy, a well-designed car, and precise team cohesion must all come together to deliver a near-flawless race day for him to see the podium. Among these factors, perhaps none have changed over time quite as drastically as the pitstop. A car takes a risk by entering the pit lane at reduced speed and getting its old tires swapped out by a team of skilled mechanics, hoping to eventually regain lost positions on new, fresher tires. Over the years, additional elements like refueling have come and gone from the official F1 pit stop regulations, but the core idea behind these crucial breaks in racing remains the same - immediate risk for eventual speed.\nSince the ban of refueling and the onset of the “modern” era of Formula 1 racing in 201, two teams have dominated the sport - Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team and Oracle Red Bull Racing. Relatively new teams at the time that had evolved out of older, less successful teams, each went on multi-year championship runs led by stars like Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen. However, such success begs the question - was it truly the pure racing skill of their drivers, their highly advanced cars, or something else that was responsible for their success? In this post, we investigate whether or not the speed of the humble pitstop played a role in these racing dynasties. Are championships truly pieced together like the four tires on a race car? Or are drivers and engineers truly the driving factors? Let’s find out.\nFor reference: Red Bull won the Formula 1 Constructor’s Championship from 2010-2013, and again in 2022 and 2023. Mercedes won the championship from 2014-2021.\nTo analyze pitstops, which vary so greatly in duration, duration has been averaged out and ranked across the ten current F1 teams.\nRed Bull’s operational and technical efficiency in the pits has been on full display throughout both of their runs. Mercedes? They’ve jumped up and down.\n\n\nCode\n### Plot Data\n\n# Bump Chart - focus on particular team\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data = bump_data, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = bump_data, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bump(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"#00A19B\", size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"#00A19B\", size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_bump(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"navy\", size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(bump_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, group = team),\n    color = \"navy\", size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = mrb_min_year, aes(x = year, y = pit_rank, label = team),\n    nudge_x = 0.3, nudge_y = 1, size = 4, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(min(bump_data$year), max(bump_data$year), 1),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    breaks = seq(1, max(bump_data$pit_rank), 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Dominating the Decade from the Pits\",\n    subtitle = \"Red Bull and Mercedes have dominated Formula 1 for the past 15 years. However, Red Bull has ruled the pits \\nin each of its championship seasons, while Mercedes has not - are other factors at play for the Silver Arrows?\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Pit Stop Ranking (based on average duration)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Red Bull’s pit ranking took significant hits following their initial success. This coincided with the introduction of the hybrid V6 engine, a change that Mercedes capitalized on significantly to begin their string of championships. However, this isn’t to say that Red Bull sank to the bottom - their stops just weren’t the quickest anymore.\nAcross the board, F1’s elite racing teams are VERY consistent with their stops. Every team has their good days and their bad days, but over time, their stops vary little. Over the past 15 years Red Bull has remained the most consistent, with Mercedes only a few places behind. Other, less successful teams stand between the two, indicating stops may not always be a huge differentiating factor.\n\n\nCode\n# Dumbbell Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = dumb_data, aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"), aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2.5,\n    colour = \"#00A19B\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"), aes(y = reorder(team, range), x = fastest_stop, xend = slowest_stop), size = 2.5,\n    colour = \"navy\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = fastest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(fastest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = -2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Mercedes\"),\n    aes(x = slowest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(slowest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = 2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = fastest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(fastest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = -2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(dumb_data, team == \"Red Bull\"),\n    aes(x = slowest_stop, y = reorder(team, range), label = (round(slowest_stop, 1))),\n    nudge_x = 2,\n    size = 3.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(10, 60),\n    breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 5),\n    minor_breaks = NULL\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impressive Speed or Costly Stumbles?\",\n    subtitle = \"F1 teams tend to have a similar range between their fastest and slowest stops. While Red Bull's smaller range \\nshowcases their technical and strategic expertise, Mercedes' isn't significantly better than some midfield teams.'\",\n    x = \"Pit Stop Duration (Seconds)\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm. It’s starting to look like Lewis Hamilton may really just have been THAT good. Maybe.\nBeyond stop consistency, though, we come back to our original question: Have we seen clear evidence of pit stops correlating with championship success? Let’s look at the clearest indicator of championship success - places and points over the course of different seasons.\n\n\nCode\n##### Bubble Chart\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = bubble_data, aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(bubble_data, team == \"Mercedes\"), aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"#00A19B\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(bubble_data, team == \"Red Bull\"), aes(x = avg_duration, y = avg_finish, size = total_points), color = \"navy\") +\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    limits = c(1, 10),\n    breaks = seq(1, 10, by = 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Do Teams Get From the Pits to the Points?\",\n    subtitle = \"Mercedes' (teal) stops weren't significantly faster or slower than most teams', while Red Bull's (navy) \\nsometimes were. Both teams, however, consistently placed high and took home the largest number of points.\",\n    x = \"Average Pit Stop Duration (seconds)\",\n    y = \"Average Season Finishing Position\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: Formula One World Championship (1950-2024) | By Allan Muinov\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s no surprise that Red Bull and Mercedes have scored the largest amount of points and consistently had some of the highest finishing positions in the modern era. What’s interesting is that other teams’ stop durations tended to be around the same, if only a second or two slower, on average. While the two titans almost always placed higher, they didn’t necessarily seem to have superb stops. Red Bull had a couple seasons of brilliance, but even these appear to be outliers.\nThe Formula One World Championship has been more or less of a two-horse race in recent years. Success in the pit lane has appeared to be more of a factor for Red Bull, who are known for their strict operational efficiency, than for Mercedes. Getting the jump on the hybrid era and bringing on superstar Lewis Hamilton seemed to have been enough for the Silver Arrows, whereas Red Bull relied more on a combination of strategy and technology for their success. While it’s McLaren that’s been dominating both of these spheres the past two years, old champions can easily rise again in the ever-changing landscape of F1. Only time will tell if their time in the metaphorical championship pit lane this season will pay off."
